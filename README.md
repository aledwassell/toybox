A repo where I've been testing and learning a variety of js tools and techs:

it's a bit silly giving sheep human names but
I used Handlebars to build a list of items displaying a sublist of items, 
 
I was also able to inject a new object into the middle of the list first by finding the length of the json array called 'sheep'
and dividing it by two,
using Math.floor to round that number to the nearest decimal point.
Then I spliced the inital array and plugged the new object in using js splice funtion.
 
I have also been playing here with:
・fetch() using the new XMLHttpRequest function, dragging in data from an external json file
・Having used fetch I also want to learn more about promises.
・Reduce trying to understand how it works!
・I've been exploring Map/Reduce/Filter
Dependancy injection.
