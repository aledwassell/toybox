A repo displaying my Handlebars.js learning:

it's a bit silly giving sheep human names but
 I used Handlebars to build a list of items displaying a sublist of items, 
 
 I was also able to inject a new object into the middle of the list first by finding the length of the json array called 'sheep'
 and dividing it by two,
 using Math.floor to round that number to the nearest decimal point.
 Then I spliced the inital array and plugged the new object in using js splice funtion.
